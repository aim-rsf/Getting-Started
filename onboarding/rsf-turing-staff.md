# Welcome! ðŸŒŸ

First of all, a massive welcome to the AI for Multiple Long-Term Conditions (AIM)! Weâ€™re so excited that youâ€™ve joined. 

**The first day (and week) is normally full of HR things and getting set up so access this whenever itâ€™s useful for you**. Thereâ€™s a whole of info captured and linked here that hopefully will help get you set up.

### Disclaimer about notes & abbreviations.

Many of the notes taken during meetings abbreviate someones name to their initials. This is a very â€˜Turingâ€™ approach and itâ€™s adopted in this document. If you want an overview of who people are then check out [Whoâ€™s Who](https://intelligent-designs.notion.site/Who-s-Who-8742f6be56ec46ecb9449b2ac960fb85) or the [People.md](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/nihr-aim-rsf/blob/main/PEOPLE.md) on GitHub.

## About the AIM-RSF

The AIM programme has a dedicated Research Support Facility (RSF), the goal of which is to support the work of the seven AIM consortia and help them embed best practices throughout their research.

You can find a recap in the [AIM RSF Getting started](https://github.com/aim-rsf/Getting-Started) repository README file or a more official one on the [Turing website](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/ai-multiple-long-term-conditions-research-support-facility). 

The RSF is a distributed and largely remote team. RSF staff are affiliated with the Turing, Swansea, or Edinburgh but are based all over the UK. Feel free to visit the Turing office whenever youâ€™d like, or join from home whenever that works. 

## How we use GitHub

The AIM RSF has a GitHub Organization that was created with an educational license in order to support collaboration across the consortia and to allow the data wranglers to work closely with the groups to produce some reusable code.
The Getting Started repository from the AIM RSF organisation can help new people to get started with the project (this is probably where you are reading this!).

Kirstie Whitaker set up a [private repository](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/nihr-aim-rsf) as part of the Turing GitHub organization.
This repository has to stay private and for internal Turing use only as it contains information about funding and grant applications.
Youâ€™ll have access to this repository where you can find a bunch of background information.
If you feel like reading through to get grounded in the project, feel free!

In this repository you can also find the [Knowledge Management](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/nihr-aim-rsf/blob/sophia-knowledge-management/community-management/knowledge-management.md) document which details out what should/could go where.

There is also a Sharepoint environment and a Microsoft Teams team.
There we keep files that are about RSF project management.
To get access to those, you need to contact Dave Chapman.

## Meetings and Events

There are multiple events organised by the RSF, both external- and internal-facing:
- **Open Invitation Seminars**, the purpose of which is to share knowledge and stimulate discussion on AI and Multiple Long-Term Conditions research
- **Internal Cross-Consortia meetings** provide a dedicated space to collaboratively explore challenges and opportunities in the research of AIM consortia
- **Public and Patient Involvement and Engagement lunchtime sessions** provide an informal space to discuss ideas and challenges on PPIE
- **Early Career Researcher lunchtime sessions** provide an informal space to discuss ideas and challenges for Early Career Researchers
- **Training sessions and workshops** will be provided as needed

## Office Visits

While you're waiting for your staff pass you can either

1. wait till 9:30am and come in the main entrance when the Library opens
2. or email [facilities@turing.ac.uk](mailto:facilities@turing.ac.uk) 24hrs ahead of time and ask to be added to the Gate 8 list (itâ€™s a side gate that lets you go directly up to the offices

## Who to ask questions:

**Easy answer**: anyone! 

**Nuanced answer**: your line manager will be a wealth of knowledge about Turing related things, HR, and other info. Dave Chapman, the Programme Manager, is the hub of all knowledge when it comes to AIM-RSF.

### ðŸš€ Overall, hereâ€™s to a great first week and beyond! ðŸš€
