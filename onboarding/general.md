# Welcome! ðŸŒŸ

First of all, a massive welcome to the AI for Multiple Long-Term Conditions (AIM)! Weâ€™re so excited that youâ€™ve joined. 


# AIM-RSF Specific Onboarding

- [ ] Invitation to the AIM RSF Slack

## About the AIM-RSF

The AIM programme has a dedicated Research Support Facility (RSF), the goal of which is to support the work of the seven AIM consortia and help them embed best practices throughout their research. The RSF is a distributed and largely remote team.

You can find a recap in the [AIM RSF Getting started](https://github.com/aim-rsf/Getting-Started) repository README file or a more official one on the [Turing website](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/ai-multiple-long-term-conditions-research-support-facility). 

## How we use GitHub

The AIM RSF has a GitHub Organization that was created with an educational license in order to support collaboration across the consortia and to allow the data wranglers to work closely with the groups to produce some reusable code. The Getting Started repository within the AIM RSF organisation can help new people to get started with the project - that's probably where you're reading this!

## Meetings and Events

There are multiple events organised by the RSF, both external- and internal-facing:
- **Open Invitation Seminars**, the purpose of which is to share knowledge and stimulate discussion on AI and Multiple Long-Term Conditions research
- **Public and Patient Involvement and Engagement lunchtime sessions** provide an informal space to discuss ideas and challenges on PPIE
- **Early Career Researcher lunchtime sessions** provide an informal space to discuss ideas and challenges for Early Career Researchers
- **Training sessions and workshops** will be provided as needed

<!-- add a link to these on the website when it is launched -->
