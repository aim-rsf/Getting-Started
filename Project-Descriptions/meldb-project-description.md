# Plain English Summary – MELD-b

## Background to the research 
A growing number of people are living with several long-term health conditions like diabetes, heart disease, depression or dementia. 
We call this multimorbidity. Many things throughout a person’s life influence the chances of developing health conditions. 
This includes their biology (e.g. age, ethnicity), things that happen to them (e.g. infections, accidents), behaviours (e.g. smoking, diet) 
and broader experiences (e.g. the environment people grew up in, their education, work, income). People from more disadvantaged backgrounds 
and/or certain ethnicities are more likely to develop multimorbidity and to develop it   earlier. The impact (or ‘burden’) of multimorbidity, 
and the order that people develop conditions, also vary. We don’t know what all the possible opportunities are to prevent burdensome multi-morbidity. 

## Aims of the research
We aim to understand more about what things influence the way people develop early multimorbidity over their lifetime and the burden this has for them. 
By ‘early’ we mean before age 65. This will identify key time points in a person’s life where prevention efforts should be targeted or strengthened to 
reduce the risk of that person developing burdensome multimorbidity. 

## Design and methods used
1.	To understand what ‘burdensome’ means for people with multimorbidity and how it could be prevented or reduced, we will ask patients, 
carers and multimorbidity experts their views and carefully summarise previous research on this issue.

2.	Ideally, we would study very large numbers of people from birth to death. However, not enough of this type of data is available. 
Therefore, we will use Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods (using computers to learn patterns from data) to help us connect information 
and knowledge from two very big General Practitioner datasets with information from three ‘birth cohorts’ – research studies of people all born in
the same year (e.g. 1970) and followed throughout their lives. 

3.	We will also use AI methods to help us understand the order in which people develop conditions and how they group together to become ‘burdensome’. 

4.	We will have experts and members of the public in a ‘People, Policy and Impact’ group identify opportunities to prevent burdensome multimorbidity. 

## Patient and Public Involvement 
A diverse ten-person Patient and Public Advisory Board will oversee the project. Members of the Board will actively engage with each element 
of the project and be asked to discuss results as they emerge. This will ensure that the experiences and priorities of people living with 
multimorbidity will always be considered.  Their input will ensure all decisions consider the experiences and priorities of people with multimorbidity. 

## Dissemination
Our ‘People, Policy and Impact’ group will share our learning and influence policy and practice on preventing burdensome multimorbidity 
by co-producing public health advice.  We will share findings through academic channels, a website and social media.
