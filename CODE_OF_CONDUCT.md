# Code of Conduct

## 1. Purpose
A primary goal of our AI for Multiple Long Term Conditions Community is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion.
This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.
We invite all those who participate in the AIM RSF Community to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

## 2. Open Collaborations in Science
A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open source literacy, and to foster open collaborations across the AIM Consortia by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.
Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society, and especially across the medical domain.
If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, please pay it forward. 

## 3. Expected Behaviour

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:

* Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
* Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
* Attempt collaboration before conflict.
* Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
* Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.
* Demonstrate empathy and kindness toward other people, and be respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences. 
* Treat everything as an opportunity to learn and accept responsibility and apologize to those affected by our mistakes when they occur. 
* Focus on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community. 


## 4. Unacceptable Behavior
The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:
* Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.
* Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
* Posting or displaying explicit or violent material.

* Personal insults and trolling on topics related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability. 
* Public or private harassment towards any members of our community. 
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission. Please refer to the [Privacy Policy](./PRIVACY_POLICY.md) for more information. 
* Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or jokes; inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual advances.

## 5. Enforcement Responsibilities

The AIM RSF Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate. 

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible. 

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, speaking on behalf of the AIM RSF, representing the AIM RSF or its activities at a conference or other public setting either online or offline.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
sbatchelor@turing.ac.uk.
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.
